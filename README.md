# stream-dash
Visualising GitHub API event streams



The exercise consists in developing a client-side Angular page that takes as input at least:
 - a Github stream URL (such as https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/events or https://api.github.com/events)
 - a pair of dates

This page should display these events in a table, and filter them according to the the inputs (e.g. between two dates).

Requirements
 - Written in Angular
 - Tested
 - Git repository to allow us to build the app

Optionally, the following graphical elements may be added to the page and react accordingly to the filtering:
 - events timeline
 - events pie chart.
